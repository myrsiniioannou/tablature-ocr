# Tablature-OCR

<b>Tablature-OCR</b> is a Python application of symbolic music, developed to meet the digitization needs of the work of Angelos Gialamas. The system transcribes handwritten tablature exercises of specific string instruments, to digital ones. In addition, it leverages a custom-trained object detection model and utilizes various machine-learning techniques to integrate processes. Gialamas developed an innovative learning method of string instruments like classical and flamenco guitar, oud and bouzouki, which drastically reduces the time required to achieve finger independence, strengthening and stretching.
